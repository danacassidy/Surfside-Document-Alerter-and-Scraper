# Surfside-Document-Alerter-and-Scraper
I built this script in light of the tragic building collapse that occurred in Surfside, FL. The purpose of this script is to see if the city of Surfside uploaded (or took down) any public record documents about Champlain Towers. 
The script sends an email alert to anyone I input letting them know when a change on the website occurs. The script also scrapes a list of document names and download links whenever there is a change on the website, as sometimes public officials quietly remove documents for no directly spoken reason. These documents are all public record and this code contributes to the reporting done by the Miami Herald on this matter.
